# Arduino Projects
- Hosting archived files from different projects for my school's Open Days, both working and incomplete versions.
- These were team-based projects done in collaboration with the IT department of my school.
- Ultrasound sensor was built for the basketball machine.
- Speedometer and RPM calculator were built towards a smart bike project, which could not be completed in time and hence is an unfinished project.
